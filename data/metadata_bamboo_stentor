Metadata for bamboo_community and stentor_community.csv

DATE = observation date
JAR = original microcosm coding where B = Bamboo (assemblage A) and S = Stentor (assemblage B) and R = replicate
JAR2 = microcosms coded numerically
TRT= treatment where 1 = +I/+R, 2 = +I/-R, 3 = -I/-R, 4 = -I/+R, 5 = -R for assemblage A, and 6 = +I/+R, 7 = +I/-R, 8= -I/-R, 9= -I/+R, and 10 = -R for assemblage B; I = invader, R = resident, + = evolved - = naive

Columns following TRT are the species present in each assemblage. For the invader in the control treatment (-R), the period indicates a value of NA from SAS because these treatments lack the invader by design
Prorodon niveus (a resident) failed to establish in the +R/-I treatment and was therefore analyzed separately in all previous analyses (in analyses that drop that treatment)
